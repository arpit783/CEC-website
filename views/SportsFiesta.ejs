                    Summary
                </p>
                After the mid-semester breaks, we thought of organizing the Sports Fiesta just to keep up the enthusiasm of the
                students. Then we thought why not organize a sports competition just for the CIVILIANS. Every sports equipment was
                provided by us After conducting a verbal survey, we concluded that we can afford four-sport games in our competition
                namely-<br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cricket
                    <li>Badminton</li>
                    <li>Tug of War</li>
                    <li>Kabaddi</li>
                </ol>
                Our team divided the workforce and four to five members were responsible for conduction of each game.<br><br>

                Cricket:<br><br>
                ABN Ground was booked for two days for the conduction of this game. Total eight teams were registered including first,
                second and third yearites. Two of our members were allotted the job of the umpires and the other two of them informed
                the teams about the fixtures. Proper record copy was maintained and each ball was noted in that.<br><br>

                Badminton:<br><br>
                Badminton was conducted in the badminton courts of Jawahar Bhawan and Rajiv Bhawan. Fixtures were created and each
                player was informed prior to the match. Again three of the members were in Jawahar Bhawan and the other three were in
                the Rajiv Bhawan to manage each and every game smoothly. We organized Men’s Singles, Men’s Doubles, Women’s Singles, and
                Women’s Doubles. Girls played in the Sarojini Bhawan.<br><br>

                Tug of War:<br><br>
                This was a game which was introduced to public demand. We conducted this game in Jawahar Bhawan and made the court from
                limestone after seeing the dimensions from the internet. and was super successful. After seeing the response, Sports
                Secretaries of different Bhawan introduced this game in their intra Bhawan sports competition.<br><br>
                Kabaddi:<br><br>
                We conducted this game behind the Saraswati Mandir. Again, we made the Kabaddi court using limestone after seeing the
                dimensions from the internet. Two of us were there to watch the ongoing proceedings and informing the players about the
                fixtures. Two of us were responsible for umpiring the match and some were busy making the court.
                Winners of each game were rewarded with medals and certificates.
